So Hayden, Why did you want to start learning code?

Two very simple reasons. I wanted a job I loved and a job that could support my family.

Most of my working life I have been a salesman, and it wasn’t for “the thrill of closing the deal” or because I was truly inspired by any great salesman. I was a salesman because my father was a salesman, as was his father. I started selling because I didn’t know what I wanted to do, I felt like I had no other real options.

I have sold gym memberships, personal training, fund raising programs, food and for the last three years I have sold house’s. You know what I discovered after 10+ years of selling, I freaking hate 90% of the job. I don’t know about you, but I think hating 90% of what you are going to do for most of your life is a problem.  I needed to make a change. I wanted a career I liked or better yet loved to do. Lucky for me I married the most amazing woman in the world and with her help I was able to start exploring other career paths.

So now the question became what do I enjoy that I could make an income from? ( spoiler alert, it’s coding ) I knew I wanted to do something that had to do with creating. I have always loved putting stuff together or taking it apart. When I was a child I wanted to be an inventor and create amazing things. I forgot about that until recently, when I had to really start digging into what it was I wanted to do. That memory led me to coding, that not so new method of invention.  

After I figured the career I wanted to pursue it was easy to find programs that would help me reach my goal. I looked at quite a few bootcamps, as you all very well know there are A LOT of programs out there. Flatiron stood out to me, mostly because of the positive reviews and success stories. I applied, got accepted and here I am now. Three weeks in and I am overflowing with excitement! I am thoroughly enjoying  every “ah ha!” moment as I break down code that I created and put it back together again. Getting those lessons to pass is extremely satisfying and more importantly it is moving me one step closer to my goal.

From what I have read about the journey that I have just embarked on I am in store for a lot of frustration, confusion and maybe even a little despair, but when those times come I am going to turn back to this letter and remind myself that this journey is worth it.
