Frustration in computer programming is going to happen. It's not if, it's when. That is the nature of the career you are training for.

One of the really cool things about learning through Flatiron's online courses is that it feels like you are training for a real world job. You are given a set of parameters to create your code and then it's up to you to figure it out. You have to deal with the frustration of your code not working and being totally lost just like you would have to do in real life. 

So as you go through the program and you get stuck I say embrace the frustration, because it is going to be a big part of your future. Plus without it, without having problems and code breaking down you wouldn't have job.
