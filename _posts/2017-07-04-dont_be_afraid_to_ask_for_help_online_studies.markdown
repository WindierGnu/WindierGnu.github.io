I have never thought of myself as someone who didn't ask for help. If I didn't understand something in class I would raise my hand. If there was a procedure at work that I was even a little unclear on I would go to a supervisor. When it comes to online studies it becomes a little different. 
 
Have you ever had to call your boss or a instructor and ask them a bunch question then hang up and think of a ton more? Did you call them back? And when you did call them back did you think of more questions after you got off the phone and want to call them again? Did you? That would feel very  awkward  and uncomfortable right? That is how I feel when you using Ask Question's on learn. I constantly finish asking questions or doing a screen share only to have more questions right after. Because of this awkward feeling I don't ask again. I try and figure the problem out on my own which is good, until it's not. On several occasions not asking again has caused me a lot of frustration and many wasted hours. Recently, I had a issue setting up a [SSH](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/) for github. When I used Ask Question they sent me a guide on how to set one up. I spent a total of many hours over 3 days trying to figure it out on my own. I finally asked for help again in the form of a screen share and it took us an hour to figure it out. Turns out getting the SSH setup for my computer was far more complicated than the guide said and even the learn instructor was struggling. 
 
Had I asked for help sooner I would've found out that this problem was more complicated than my abilities and saved myself a great deal of time. That damn awkward feeling through me through a loop. I am going to fix this problem by  taking the feeling out of the equation and leaving it up two rules.  
 
1. If in 2 hours  I haven’t made any progress I am going to ask
2. If I end the session without figuring out how to solve what I was working out or move forward I am going to start the next session by asking.
 
I am new to online studies and to coding but as I understand it thus far it is very community minded. Other coders genuinely want to help you learn so keep that in mind if that awkward feeling creeps up on you. Ask your questions!
 
P.S.
Feel free to contact me if you can’t find someone to ask. If I can’t help you directly I will help you  find someone who can.
